    <abstract>
      <t>The presence of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) proxies may
      lead to infinite forwarding loops, which is undesirable. To prevent and
      detect such loops, this document specifies the Hop-Limit CoAP
      option.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>More and more applications are using Constrained Application Protocol
      (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"></xref> as a communication protocol
      between involved application agents. For example, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> specifies how CoAP is used
      as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack signaling protocol
      seeking for help from DDoS mitigation providers. In such contexts, a
      CoAP client can communicate directly with a server or indirectly via a
      proxy. </t>

      <t>When multiple proxies are involved, infinite forwarding loops may be
      experienced. To prevent such loops, this document defines a new CoAP
      option, called Hop-Limit, which is inserted by on-path proxies. Also,
      the document defines a new CoAP Response Code to report loops together
      with relevant diagnostic information to ease troubleshooting. </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Readers should be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in
      <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="spec" title="Hop-Limit Option">
      <t>Hop-Limit option (see <xref target="option"></xref>) is used to
      detect and prevent infinite loops when proxies are involved. Only one
      single instance of the option is allowed in a message.</t>

      <t>The length of the Hop-Limit option is 1 byte. The value of the
      Hop-Limit option is encoded as an unsigned integer (see Section 3.2 of
      <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>).</t>

      <t>Each intermediate proxy involved in the handling of a CoAP message
      MUST decrement the Hop-Limit option value by 1 prior to forwarding
      upstream if this parameter exists. </t>

      <t>CoAP messages MUST NOT be forwarded if the Hop-Limit option is set to
      '0' after decrement. Messages that cannot be forwarded because of
      exhausted Hop-Limit SHOULD be logged with a 5.06 (Hop Limit Reached)
      error message sent back to the CoAP peer. It is RECOMMENDED that CoAP
      agents support means to alert administrators about loop errors so that
      appropriate actions are undertaken. </t>

      <t>To ease debugging and troubleshooting, the CoAP proxy which detects a
      loop SHOULD include its information (e.g., server name, alias, IP
      address) in the diagnostic payload under the conditions detailed in
      Section 5.5.2 of <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>. </t>

      <t>Each intermediate proxy involved in relaying a 5.06 (Hop Limit
      Reached) error message SHOULD prepend its own information in the
      diagnostic payload with a space character used as separator. Only one
      information per proxy MUST appear in the diagnostic payload. </t>

      <t>The initial Hop-Limit value SHOULD be configurable. If no initial
      value is explicitly provided, the default initial Hop-Limit value of 16
      MUST be used. Because forwarding errors may occur if inadequate
      Hop-Limit values are used, proxies at the boundaries of an
      administrative domain MAY be instructed to rewrite the value of
      Hop-Limit carried in received messages (that is, ignore the value of
      Hop-Limit received in a message).</t>
