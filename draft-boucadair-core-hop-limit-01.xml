      <t>The presence of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) proxies may
      lead to infinite forwarding loops, which is undesirable. To prevent and
      detect such loops, this document specifies the Hop-Limit CoAP
      option.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>More and more applications are using Constrained Application Protocol
      (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"></xref> as a communication protocol
      between involved application agents. For example, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> specifies how CoAP is used
      as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack signaling protocol
      seeking for help from DDoS mitigation providers. In such contexts, a
      CoAP client can communicate directly with a server or indirectly via
      proxies.</t>

      <t>When multiple proxies are involved, infinite forwarding loops may be
      experienced. To prevent such loops, this document defines a new CoAP
      option, called Hop-Limit, which is inserted in particular by on-path
      proxies. Also, the document defines a new CoAP Response Code to report
      loops together with relevant diagnostic information to ease
      troubleshooting.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Readers should be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in
      <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Within this document, CoAP agent refers to both CoAP client and CoAP
      proxy.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="spec" title="Hop-Limit Option">
      <t>Hop-Limit option (see <xref target="option"></xref>) is an elective
      option used to detect and prevent infinite loops when proxies are
      involved. Only one single instance of the option is allowed in a
      message. Therefore, a message carrying multiple Hop-Limit option
      instances MUST be rejected using 4.00 (Bad Request) error message.</t>

      <t>The value of the Hop-Limit option is encoded as an 8-bit unsigned
      integer (see Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>). This value
      MUST be between 1 and 255 inclusive. CoAP messages received with a
      Hop-Limit option set to '0' or greater than '255' MUST be rejected by a
      CoAP agent using 4.00 (Bad Request). </t>

      <t>The Hop-Limit option is safe to forward. That is, a CoAP proxy which
      does not understand the Hop-Limit option should forward it on. </t>

      <t>If a CoAP proxy receives a request which does not include a Hop-Limit
      option, it SHOULD insert a Hop-Limit option when relaying the request to
      a next hop (absent explicit policy/configuration otherwise).</t>

      <t>The initial Hop-Limit value SHOULD be configurable. If no initial
      value is explicitly provided, the default initial Hop-Limit value of 16
      MUST be used. This value is chosen to be sufficiently large to guarantee
      that a CoAP request would not be dropped in networks when there were no
      loops, but not so large as to consume CoAP proxy resources when a loop
      does occur. Lower values should be used with caution and only in
      networks where topologies are known by the CoAP agent inserting the
      Hop-Limit option. </t>

      <t>Because forwarding errors may occur if inadequate Hop-Limit values
      are used, proxies at the boundaries of an administrative domain MAY be
      instructed to remove or rewrite the value of Hop-Limit carried in
      received messages (i.e., ignore the value of Hop-Limit received in a
      message).</t>

      <t>Otherwise, each intermediate proxy, which understands the Hop-Limit
      option, involved in the handling of a CoAP message MUST decrement the
      Hop-Limit option value by 1 prior to forwarding upstream if this
      parameter exists. </t>

      <t>CoAP messages MUST NOT be forwarded if the Hop-Limit option is set to
      '0' after decrement. Messages that cannot be forwarded because of
      exhausted Hop-Limit SHOULD be logged with a TBA1 (Hop Limit Reached)
      error message sent back to the CoAP peer. It is RECOMMENDED that CoAP
      agents support means to alert administrators about loop errors so that
      appropriate actions are undertaken.</t>

      <t>To ease debugging and troubleshooting, the CoAP proxy which detects a
      loop SHOULD include its information (e.g., proxy name, proxy alias, IP
      address) in the diagnostic payload under the conditions detailed in
      Section 5.5.2 of <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Each intermediate proxy involved in relaying a TBA1 (Hop Limit
      Reached) error message SHOULD prepend its own information in the
      diagnostic payload with a space character used as separator. Only one
      information per proxy SHOULD appear in the diagnostic payload. Doing so
      allows to limit the size of the TBA1 (Hop Limit Reached) error message,
      and to ease correlation with hops count. </t>

      <t>Security considerations related to CoAP proxying are discussed in
      Section 11.2 of <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The diagnostic payload of a TBA1 (Hop Limit Reached) error message
      may leak sensitive information revealing the topology of a domain. To
      prevent that, a CoAP proxy which is located at the boundary of an
      administrative domain MAY be instructed to strip the diagnostic payload
      or part of it before forwarding on the TBA1 response. </t>
